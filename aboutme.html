                            Heya! My name is Trey Leong, and I am a programmer!
                            <br><br>
                            Currently, I am taking Computing in Junior College, and intend to take Computer 
                            Science in the near future at the university level. I am currently learning Python, HTML, CSS as well
                            as Swift. Furthermore, I have also interned at many leading tech companies such as Razer.
                            <br><br>
                            I made this website as part of one of my mini projects to showcase
                            my portfolio on a website using HTML/CSS.
                            <br><br>
                            Additionally, I also am a tech enthusiast, and I am often 
                            curious about new products and ideas in the tech industry.
                            <br><br>
                            In the near future, I hope to be able to become a back-end or even full-stack developer
                            and be able to work for either myself or a leading tech company!
                            <br><br>
                            Thank you for reading! Have a great day! :&#41;
